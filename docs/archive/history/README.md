# Historical Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation from previous refactoring efforts and migration guides. These documents are preserved for reference but **do not reflect the current state of the project**.

## Contents

- **refactoring-project-summary.md** - Summary of the comprehensive refactoring project that transformed the codebase from monolithic to modular architecture
- **refactoring-summary.md** - Detailed summary of the refactoring phases and testing guide
- **refactoring-complete.md** - Completion report for the 5-phase refactoring implementation
- **migration-guide.md** - Guide for migrating from the old flat structure to the new monorepo
- **service-refactoring.md** - Documentation of RAG and summarization service decoupling

## ⚠️ Important Notice

**These documents describe past work that has already been completed.**

For current documentation, please refer to:
- [Main README](../../README.md) - Current project overview and setup
- [Quick Start Guide](../../QUICKSTART.md) - Getting started with the current system
- [Architecture Documentation](../ARCHITECTURE.md) - Current system architecture (if it exists)

## When to Use These Documents

These historical documents are useful for:
- Understanding the evolution of the project
- Learning about past architectural decisions
- Historical reference for contributors who worked on previous versions
- Context for why certain design patterns were chosen

**Do not use these for setup or development** - they reference file structures, commands, and workflows that no longer exist.
