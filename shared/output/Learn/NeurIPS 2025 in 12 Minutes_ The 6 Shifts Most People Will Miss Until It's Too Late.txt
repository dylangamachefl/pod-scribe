============================================================

[SPEAKER_00] 00:00:00: In the next 10 minutes, I'm going to give you everything you need to know about NeurIPS 2025.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:00:05: NeurIPS is the premier AI conference in the world.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:00:08: And so understanding what happened at NeurIPS is critical to understanding where AI is going in 2026.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:00:14: The conference has actually really finished its evolution from a very niche academic conference before LLMs took off to this full-blown industry trade show, right?
[SPEAKER_00] 00:00:23: So tens of thousands of people attended.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:00:25: It's split now across two cities.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:00:26: It was San Diego and Mexico City, and it really isn't forgotten.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:00:30: grad students anymore.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:00:31: It's about, you know, Big Booths, Google, Amazon, Alibaba, and all their friends, right?
[SPEAKER_00] 00:00:36: The shift matters because it tells you who is driving the agenda.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:00:39: Before, it was very much the grad student academic lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:00:44: And the questions now are much different from the academic questions in prior years.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:00:48: They're about product roadmaps, hardware launches, enterprise stories.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:00:52: What you see is a corporatized NeurIPS.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:00:55: And so if you're looking for the state of ML research, you kind of have to dig because this has become a big enough deal that the enterprises are paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:01:02: On the research side, like if you want the academic side, the volume has gone absurd.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:01:07: And that is part of the discussion at NeurIPS and it's part of what I want to communicate here.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:01:12: It takes a lot of distilling to get to what matters when you have 20,000 submissions for a single conference.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:01:19: That's too much for anyone to read, right?
[SPEAKER_00] 00:01:21: Clearly, a lot of this is AI-assisted writing, and that was something of a conversation at NURBS itself.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:01:27: The result is a real signal-to-noise problem.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:01:29: Just as you have with resumes and job descriptions, you have it here in academia as well.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:01:34: There are a handful of papers that I'm going to talk about that really move the frontier forward, but they got really buried in a long tail of slop.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:01:42: And so if you want to understand what changed this year, it's harder than ever.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:01:45: You can't just rely on conference brand anymore.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:01:48: You have to look at who is writing and whether you trust them.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:01:52: That's probably a lesson for the Internet as a whole in the next year.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:01:55: Now, underneath the noise, there are a few clear threads that you and I should care about.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:02:00: The first is what I would call new attention plumbing for LLMs.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:02:04: A lot of the most impactful work this year really isn't about completely new architectures.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:02:09: It's about changes in how LLM attention
[SPEAKER_00] 00:02:12: behaves.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:02:13: Things like gating, sparsity, eliminating attention sinks, and stabilizing long context training.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:02:18: That sounds like a ton of detail, right?
[SPEAKER_00] 00:02:20: But it's critical infrastructure level change to enable new behaviors.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:02:25: Because if attention becomes more selective and a little bit better behaved,
[SPEAKER_00] 00:02:29: you get models that better handle long documents, big code bases, messy logs that have a lot of confusion and dirty data in them.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:02:37: And even if it's not perfect, that data can be retrieved and accurately processed by a transformer with better attention.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:02:44: so that you get fewer hallucinations and you use less computed tokens.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:02:48: So you might not see splashy headlines about these papers, but six months from now, you're gonna quietly notice that these same size models are cheaper and more stable and smarter because their plumbing got swapped out.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:03:00: The second big theme is homogeneity.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:03:02: Models are converging toward the same answers.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:03:05: One of the best paper tracks this year was basically a rigorous proof that something we've all felt anecdotally is true, that when you ask the top models open-ended questions, they increasingly sound like different skins on the same brain.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:03:19: So across different vendors, across different prompts, you will often see similar phrasing, similar structure, similar values.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:03:27: That's a big deal because it means that which frontier model do we pick matters less than it did before.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:03:33: Most of these models live in what we call the same behavioral basin.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:03:38: That's a machine learning term, but it basically means the models are converging around a common behavioral and response set.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:03:44: Now, it raises a larger issue, right?
[SPEAKER_00] 00:03:46: If all the major systems collapse into an averaged out view of the world, then any bias or any blind spot or any tilt in that consensus view will get propagated everywhere at once.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:03:59: This is probably a consequence of how quickly models are spreading around the world.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:04:03: They're spreading and commoditizing, but they're using a lot of the same underlying parameters and weights, and that's leading to common results.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:04:12: A third big threat is that scaling laws are now getting into the reinforcement learning layer.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:04:17: So for years, reinforcement learning for real tasks like robotics, like logistics, like complex agents, that's really lagged behind the language and the vision side.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:04:27: But at this NeurIPS, you saw really serious work done on very deep reinforcement learning policies, like hundreds to roughly a thousand layers deep that are all trained in self-supervised or goal-conditioned ways.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:04:40: So the pattern is really familiar.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:04:42: Once you stop being stingy with your compute, with your capacity, with your depth,
[SPEAKER_00] 00:04:46: that just keeps scaling and regularizing story that worked for LLMs before starts working for agents.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:04:52: So what this means is that we suddenly have general purpose household robots around the corner because the ceiling on what agentic systems can learn from raw interaction is higher than people thought.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:05:03: And so if you're betting on automation in ops, in robotics, in simulation heavy workflows, that technical stuff around reinforcement learning for robotics, how you create reinforcement learning that are really, really deep in the neural network, and that allow an agent to train in an environment,
[SPEAKER_00] 00:05:21: over and over and over again to really get to goal conditioning that works.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:05:24: That's a frontier to keep an eye on.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:05:26: Getting to like compute enabled scaled up reinforcement learning for robotics seems like it's going to be a trend in 2026.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:05:35: Now is 2026 the year of the household robot?
[SPEAKER_00] 00:05:38: I think it's a touch early.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:05:39: But this is the kind of foundational work that enables it.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:05:43: Then there's diffusion and the growing consensus that it's not just dumb memorization of training images, right?
[SPEAKER_00] 00:05:49: One of the most talked about theory papers at NeurIPS this year makes a really strong case that diffusion training actually has two different phases.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:05:58: There's an early part of the training where the model learns to generate high quality, diverse samples and a later regime or training regime where it starts to overfit and memorize specifics.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:06:09: Crucially, as you scale the data set, the memorization phase moves further out in your training time.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:06:16: which gives you a much wider safe window to stop before the model overfits and memorizes.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:06:21: This has important implications for IP and for privacy debates.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:06:25: It doesn't magically make copyright concerns disappear because sensitive content is still risky and can still be created.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:06:32: But it does shift the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:06:34: Instead of
[SPEAKER_00] 00:06:34: diffusion models and image generators are inherently theft, which is a claim that I hear sometimes, the question becomes, how much data did you use?
[SPEAKER_00] 00:06:44: How long did you train it?
[SPEAKER_00] 00:06:45: And can you show you stayed in a generalized space versus an overfitted model space for your image generator?
[SPEAKER_00] 00:06:52: Finally, there's a really clear backlash brewing against the incentive structure of AI research itself.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:06:58: I mentioned the conversation around paper submissions.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:07:01: People inside the community are openly talking about what they call the slop crisis, hyperinflated paper counts, mentorship businesses cranking out formulaic publications, and reviewers being asked to triage impossible workloads of papers.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:07:16: The conference is experimenting with AI to help review AI-generated papers, which is kind of funny and a little bit dystopian.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:07:23: But the deeper issue is around trust, right?
[SPEAKER_00] 00:07:25: If leading venues cannot reliably separate real breakthroughs from padded noise, then companies and regulators and practitioners are going to start to ignore the NeurIPS brand and build their own filters.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:07:36: That's kind of the meta story for this, NeurIPS.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:07:39: It's not just what got published, but there's a growing recognition that the way we reward and gatekeep our AI research is breaking under its own success.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:07:49: And everybody downstream is going to need to be more selective.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:07:52: The implication is that you need to think about who you're listening to and who you're trusting around these papers and where your signal to noise ratio is.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:08:00: It is no longer viable with 20,000 paper submissions to read every academic paper posted on ARCSIV about AI.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:08:07: It just, nobody can do it.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:08:08: And so much of it is slop that it's not worth reading.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:08:11: You have to have a thoughtful approach to look at the trends, which is exactly what I've tried to do here.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:08:18: Let me close by sharing what the big labs, the big model makers are quietly saying, because I think if they're at the conference, if they're submitting papers, we should pay attention to what they're submitting.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:08:28: Number one, reasoning is a metric.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:08:31: Reasoning is something you can measure and think about.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:08:33: Apple's an
[SPEAKER_00] 00:08:33: Apple and others are pushing for an evaluation framing around reasoning where we instrument the process, step-by-step reasoning, tool calls, search usage, and not just final answer accuracy.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:08:44: This could improve overall generalizable performance for LLMs because it means you can replicate the process more reliably.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:08:51: That plays directly into tool use, into agents, into MCP style protocols.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:08:56: Reasoning traces themselves become telemetry that you can use to figure out if your model is working right.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:09:03: Another big theme for major model makers is around efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:09:07: There's a heavy focus on how you can make generative models and generative vision models too, really efficient and small and quantized so that they can live on phones, on laptops, on low power devices.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:09:19: There's a narrative shift this year among the major model makers at NeurIPS from we have the biggest model to, yeah, we have a great model, but we can run strong models where your users actually are with low latency on edge devices.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:09:33: In other words, the frontier race is becoming about more than model size and it's becoming about how we think about reasoning.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:09:39: It's becoming about how we think about putting the model where the user is and how you can plug the model into tooling and workflows.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:09:46: I think those three themes, efficiency, reasoning, evaluation, and improvements, and plugging models into tooling and workflows are really good proxies for big themes we're going to see in 2026 from major model makers.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:10:00: I keep saying, if you're asking yourself, what's the best model at this point, you're probably asking the wrong question.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:10:07: You should ask, what's the most useful model on this device?
[SPEAKER_00] 00:10:11: Can it do the job?
[SPEAKER_00] 00:10:12: Does it plug into my workflow so it's not just existing in isolation?
[SPEAKER_00] 00:10:17: And can I use it efficiently so the tokens are not wasted?
[SPEAKER_00] 00:10:21: That's what the major model makers are thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:10:24: And I think that's one of the takeaways from NeurIPS that I am pulling and thinking about as I look into 2026.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:10:30: I hope you enjoyed this NeurIPSOM.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:10:32: It certainly is faster than the conference as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:10:35: So enjoy and let me know what you think I missed or what you'd like to learn more about.
[SPEAKER_00] 00:10:39: Cheers.
